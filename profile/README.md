## 🧩 Overview  

**CloudMounter for macOS** is an advanced file management utility that lets you connect and work with all your cloud storage accounts directly from Finder. Developed by **Eltima Software**, it transforms remote cloud services into easily accessible local drives, allowing you to open, edit, and manage files without syncing them to your Mac.  

With CloudMounter, you can link multiple accounts from **Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Amazon S3, Box**, and other popular cloud providers. Files are displayed as if they’re stored locally, but all actions—upload, move, rename, or delete—are performed instantly on the cloud.  

The app prioritizes security through **data encryption**, ensuring your cloud connections remain private and fully protected. It integrates smoothly with macOS, maintaining native support for **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)** and **macOS Sonoma**, while preserving the familiar Finder experience.  

Perfect for professionals who manage large files, freelancers who switch between storage providers, or teams who collaborate across multiple platforms, **CloudMounter** simplifies remote storage and boosts productivity with a clean, efficient workflow.
